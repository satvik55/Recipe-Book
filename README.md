# Recipe Book Web Application

This is a simple web-based Recipe Book application that allows users to add, view, and search for their favorite recipes. It's built as a front-end application using standard web technologies.

## Features:
* **Add New Recipes**: Users can input the recipe name, an optional image URL, a list of ingredients, and detailed preparation steps.
* **View All Recipes**: All saved recipes are displayed in a responsive grid format.
* **Recipe Details**: Clicking on any recipe card opens a pop-up modal displaying its full details, including a larger image, complete ingredients list, and all preparation steps.
* **Delete Recipe**: An option to delete a recipe is available within its detail view.
* **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes by entering keywords that match recipe names or ingredients.
* **Data Persistence**: All recipes are saved locally in the browser's Local Storage. This ensures that recipes remain available even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed with a clear and intuitive layout, making it easy to navigate and use.

## Technologies Used:
* **HTML5**: For structuring the content and defining the elements of the web application.
* **CSS3**: For styling the application, making it visually appealing, and ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: For all interactive functionalities, including form handling, dynamic content generation, modal management, search logic, and persistent data storage using `localStorage`.

## How to Set Up and Run Locally:

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    * If you have Git installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Recipe-Book.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Recipe-Book.git)
        ```
        (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username, e.g., `satvik55`).
    * Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to your desired location.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to the `Recipe Book` folder:
    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox). You can do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer or by dragging it directly into an open browser window.
